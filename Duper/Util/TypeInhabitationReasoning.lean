     whether it can be removed (in which case, its id is added to `mvarIdsToRemove`).

     We iterate through the mclause's mvars in reverse order so that we can handle dependencies between types correctly. For example, if we have
     `∀ x : t, ∀ y : f(x), p(y)`, then we cannot remove `y` because the clause body depends on it, and because we cannot remove `y`, we also cannot remove `x` (since
     `y`'s type depends on it). By iterating through the clause's mvars in reverse order, we ensure that we see `y` and add its type `f(x)` to `preservedMVarTypes`
     before we see `x`, so that when we see `x`, we can identify that it must be kept on the grounds that there is a type in `preservedMVarTypes` that depends on `x`.

     Note that because we have mvarIdsToRemove as a list (and add elements using cons rather than append), the last mvarIds we add to the list will appear first
     in the list which ensures that at the end, mvarIds corresponding to earlier bvars appear before mvarIds corresponding to later bvars. When dependent types are
     at play, preserving this invariant is important to ensure that `Duper.RuleM.neutralizeMClauseInhabitedReasoningOn` processes `mvarIdsToRemove` correctly. -/

    verifiedNonemptyTypes can have a state where `α` `α → β` are both in verifiedNonemptyTypes but `β` is not, but this
    will only occur after `deriveNewNonemptyTypes` returns if either `Nonempty α` or `Nonempty (α → β)` was generated by
